# ReltradStata
This code recodes the General Social Survey data on religious tradition (variable is *xaffil*)  and codes into the Reltrad categories to match Steensland et al.

You need to download the GSS file in Stata format from NORC's website and edit the code to reflect where the file is stored.

This is based on Brian Stark's data.
