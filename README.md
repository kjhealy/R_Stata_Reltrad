# Reltrad in R and Stata
This code recodes the General Social Survey data on religious tradition and codes into the Reltrad categories to match Steensland et al. This uses a mix of variables in the GSS, denom, other, and race, among others.

You need to download the GSS file in Stata format from NORC's website and edit the code to reflect where the file is stored. This post explains how [https://www.davideagle.org/post/creating-reltrad/](https://www.davideagle.org/post/creating-reltrad/). You must remove the black oversample from the GSS and also calculate final proportions using weights.
